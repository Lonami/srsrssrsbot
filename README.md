# srsrssrsbot

A **s**e**r**iou**s rss r**u**s**t **bot**. No apologies with respect to the name.

## What?

I use Telegram, and follow several RSS feeds. I want to be notifed in Telegram when those feeds
have something new. I want to be in control of the code that does this. So I wrote my own bot.

The code is using [grammers](https://github.com/lonami/grammers), a library to interact with
Telegram's client API from Rust. You will need to clone that repository in a sibling directory,
since the code targets the very last version of the library.

## That's the best name you can come up with?

Yes.
